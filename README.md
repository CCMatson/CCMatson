# Hello, I'm Catherine!

I'm a software engineering fellow at General Assembly. I'm studying Full Stack development in Seattle, WA.

I recently finished a MEN stack application that utililizes MongoDB to collect and store recipe links. Check out the "recipe-collector" pinned repo, and let me know what you think!

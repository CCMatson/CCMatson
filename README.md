# Hello, I'm Catherine!

<!-- ![catherine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118697436/210265383-fa6381c4-0779-4635-802f-df1e3b4fb4cd.png) -->

I'm a full-stack developer on the West Coast, and a graduate of General Assembly Software Engineering Intensive. My pivot into tech comes after five great years as a STEM educator.

I recently finished a PERN stack application that utililizes React and Typsescript on the front-end, and postgreSQL on the back-end, so that users can collect, index, edit, and delete shoes from a shoe collection. Check it out in my pinned repos below!

When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching movies and spending time in nature.
